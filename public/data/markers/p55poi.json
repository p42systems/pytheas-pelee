    "The Point is the southernmost tip of mainland Canada. Repeat visitors will note the shape and size of the tip changes with the wind and waves.",
    "The tip is a great place to experience the natural beauty and majesty of Lake Erie, but it is prohibited to enter the water at this location. The waves can be unpredictable and dangerous, and the area is not monitored by lifeguards.",
